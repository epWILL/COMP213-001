        <dt>What is a yurt?</dt>
        <dd>
          Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground.
          Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a
          roof dome that can be opened.
        </dd>
        <dt>How are the yurts furnished?</dt>
        <dd>
          Each yurt is furnished with a queensize bed with down quit and
          gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping experience includes electricity
          and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom
          facilities are located in the lodge.

          Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for
          changing weather with light layers of clothing. It is also helpful to
          bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure! Save your page and test
